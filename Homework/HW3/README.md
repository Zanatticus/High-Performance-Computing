# Homework 3 - README

See [EECE5640-HW3.pdf](EECE5640-HW3.pdf) for the homework description. Each problem has its own folder with the corresponding code and results. Each problem subfolder contains a README file with answers to the homework questions. In any subfolder with a `Makefile`, simply run `make` to compile and run the code unless otherwise specified in the problem README (the default `make` command is set to do both code compilation/running and not just compilation).
