# Problem 3 (20 Points)

In this problem, you will modify the `matmul.c` program provided, optimizing the execution of the matrix multiplication with first a dense matrix, and second with a sparse matrix. You are welcome to use **pthreads**, **OpenMP**, or any of the optimizations that were presented in class to accelerate this code. Do not change the sparsity of the matrices in `matmul.c`. Do not use a **GPU** and do not use **OpenBLAS** in your solution.  

There will be prizes awarded for the **fastest dense** and the **fastest sparse** implementations.
