# Problem 4 (20 Points)

In this problem, you will utilize the OpenBLAS library available on Explorer. To use OpenBLAS, you will need to issue `load openblas/0.3.29`. You can refer to the `blas_simple.c` code provided for an example code.

a.) Develop a matrix-matrix multiplication, multiplying two single-precision floating point matrices that are **256Ã—256** elements. Compare your implementation to your dense implementation in problem 3. Discuss which result is faster and why.

b.) Run your **OpenBLAS-accelerated** program on two different CPU platforms in Explorer. Discuss the **CPUs** you are using, and the **performance differences** you obtain.
