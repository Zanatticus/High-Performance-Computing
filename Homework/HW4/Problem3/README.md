# Problem 3 (30 Points)

Performance analysis of MPI applications has been an active area of research. There have been many performance tools developed to support performance MPI applications. Please identify two of these frameworks and compare and contrast the capabilities of the toolsets you have selected. Make sure to cite all your resources. Please do not copy text out of user guides when you discuss the frameworks.

## Answers

### TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities)

TAU is a performance profiling and tracing toolkit that supports parallel profiling (MPI, OpenMPI, etc...) for multiple languages (Fortran, C, C++, Java, Python). It gathers performance information through function, method, basic block, and statement instrumentation, and also provides instrumentation control via selection of profiling groups [1].

### Intel VTune Profiler

The Intel VTune Profiler can optimize the entire application performance for CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs for multiple languages (SYCL, C, C++, C#, Fortran, OpenCL code, Python, Google Go programming language, Java, .NET, Assembly, or any combination of languages). It gathers system data for extended periods of time or it can gather detailed results directly mapped to source code [3]
