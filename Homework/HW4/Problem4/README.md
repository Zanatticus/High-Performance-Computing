# Problem 4 (25 Extra Credit Points)

(Extra credit for everyone) Part of your weekly reading included a paper titled "MPI on Millions of Cores." Given that this paper was published in 2010 (15 years ago), can you comment on what changes have occurred since 2010 that could positively and/or negatively impact our ability to fully exploit parallelism on millions of cores? Many of the papers today discuss exascale-computing. Select a recent paper on exascale-computing and compare/contrast the barriers identified in the two papers that impact our ability to achieve these milestones.

**This problem is worth 25 points of extra credit for the undergraduates and PlusOne students in the class and 15 points of extra credit for the graduate students.**
