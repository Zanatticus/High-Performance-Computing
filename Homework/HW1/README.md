# Homework 1 - README

See [EECE5640-HW1.pdf](EECE5640-HW1.pdf) for the homework description. Each problem has its own folder with the corresponding code and results. Each problem subfolder contains a README file with answers to the homework questions along with a PDF version of the README. In any subfolder with a `Makefile`, simply run `make` to compile and run the code (the default `make` command is set to do both code compilation/running and not just compilation).
