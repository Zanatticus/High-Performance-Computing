# Problem 4 (10 Points)

Read the paper provided on Sparse Matrix-Vector (SpMV) reordering optimizations performed on multicore processors. (only parts a and b are required)

a.) Select one of the reordering schemes described and provide pseudocode (i.e., detailed steps and describe the transformations) for 2 of the schemes described in the paper.
b.) For 1 of the hardware platforms discussed in the paper, provide the details of the associated memory hierarchy on the system.
c.) Completing this part is optional, but can earn extra credit on your quiz average. 

Develop your own SpMV (sparse matrix-vector multiplication) implementation that uses one of the memory reordering algorithms described in the paper (6 are provided). You will need to generate your own sparse matrices or use those available from MatrixMarket (https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/). Report on the speedup achieved as compared to using the standard dense SpMV kernel approach. 

Students can earn an extra 10 points of extra credit for implementing and evaluating each memory reordering algorithm (60 maximum points).

* Written answers to the questions should be included in your homework 2 write-up in pdf format. You should include your C/C++ program and the README file in the zip file submitted.
