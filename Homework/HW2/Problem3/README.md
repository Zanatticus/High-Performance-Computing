# Problem 3 (30 Points)

Graph coloring involves coloring a graph G (V, E) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This algorithm is used in several important applications, including register allocation in compilers, sparse matrix ordering and VLSI routing. The goal is to use the least number of colors to color the graph. An exact solution to graph coloring is NP-hard. You donâ€™t need to obtain the optimal solution (i.e., you can use a greedy approach). Make sure to test your solution with different graphs that you will generate. Describe how you tested your implementation.

a.) There are a few approaches you can take to solve this problem. Develop your solution using OpenMP.
b.) Evaluate the strong scaling and weak scaling performance of your implementation. Compare the runtime taken to the algorithmic complexity (big-O) of the algorithm you have chosen for your implementation. 

* Written answers to the questions should be included in your homework 2 write-up in pdf format. You should include your C/C++ program and the README file in the zip file submitted.
